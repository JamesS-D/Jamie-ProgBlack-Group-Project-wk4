#REVIEW OF Jamie-ProgBlack-Group-Project-wk4 by Practical Group 3 (JBourton Repository)

| Catagory      |  Rating |  Review |
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | 
| Interest of Content  | **Sound - 47** | Content for the medical section was interesting, but the other 2 written pages left much to be desired due to their lack of content. Furthermore, the 4th page doesn't even exist in terms of content. The Chosen topics are quite unrelated, but majority of credit goes to the medical section  |
| Consistency and quality of visual presentation | **Acceptable - 43** | Each page has a very different style, although at least the navbar has some consistency in terms of maintaining a constant feature across pages. The visual presentation is also very different in terms of pages that use images/don't use images. The AI and Climate Change page is particularly out of place, using a very different style to the other pages |
| Quality of written presentation | **Very good - 63** | Of what is written, the quality is very good. There are very few spelling mistakes, with only a few exceptions (such as 'intelligence'). Paragraphs mostly follow on from one another well. Mark is brought down a bit by lack of 4th page (no written presentation) and slide on AI/Climate change.|
| Validity of HTML | **Excellent - 72** | Of what is written, the quality of the HTML is mostly very good. The reason the mark is not higher is due to the exclusion of alt tags for images used on the webpage, which is considered an essential feature of professional HTML|
| Evidence of collaboration | **Acceptable - 40** | There is some evidence of collaboration, with all members contributing at least one commit. Despite this, the proportion of contributions across members is uneven. Jamie has contributed far more than other members for example, and more effort should have been made for collaboration. This would in turn lead to a more consistent design theme across pages, which is an issue for another marking area. Another point of issue is the lack of author details written by other members. |
